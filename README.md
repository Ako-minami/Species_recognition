# Bycatch Species Classifier

This repository contains tools, model.pt, and notebooks for preprocessing image datasets published on ZENODO, organizing data splits, and analyzing species classification results from French fisheries observer data in purse seine and longliners.


This project focuses on:
- Structuring image datasets collected by observers on board French fishing vessels.
- Automatically organizing images.
- Generating clean train/validation/test splits.
- Supporting the evaluation and visualization of classification results from YOLO models.
